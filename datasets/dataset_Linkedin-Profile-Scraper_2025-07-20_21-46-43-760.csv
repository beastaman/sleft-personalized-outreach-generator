"I founded Aberdeen Advisors in 2009 because I went through the process of building, owning, and selling a business. It was very confusing at times. My goal was to create a company that simplifies a very complex process and helps business owners get top dollar for their profitable business. 

Aberdeen Advisors specializes in selling companies based in the Southeast with revenues of $5 million to $100 million. 

I’m an experienced deal maker, having advised hundreds of sellers and connected them with qualified buyers. My strengths lie in using my industry connections and drawing on my personal experience to make the best deal possible for all parties. Aberdeen Advisors uses a proven 6-step process to sell a business for the most money, while getting the best terms and conditions with the fastest closing date. 

My book, Turn Your Blood, Sweat & Tears Into Cash: A Guide to Sell Your Business is a comprehensive guide that covers everything from pre-sale preparations to what to expect during the process. It describes both mechanisms for success and common pitfalls to avoid. Easy to understand, it includes real-life examples. Profitable business owners who want to sell their business for top dollar will find this book to be a valuable resource.

I am also a featured speaker, offering insight to CEOs and business owners who are passionate about their companies. My presentations include “The 7 Deadliest Mistakes When Selling a Business” “Is Now The Right Time To Sell?” and “Maximize the Value of Your Business.”

If you own a profitable business that you are considering selling, contact me at emery@aberdeenadvisors.com and let’s talk about how Aberdeen Advisors can streamline the process while getting you the most money for your business.",United States,Greater Tampa Bay Area,Greater Tampa Bay Area,2009,Investment Banking,linkedin.com/company/aberdeen-advisors-inc.,"Aberdeen Advisors, Inc.",10-Jan,aberdeenadvisors.com,6646,,,,,,,,,,,,,16 yrs 3 mos,16.25,FALSE,1980 - 1984,22504,https://www.linkedin.com/company/22504/,urn:li:fsd_company:22504,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQFCivwH5KIFlA/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1631325180050?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=TsfC_pB0fBY2b7xG7xr5XQstZ7fm1bRkMfoZptH4WD0,,,,,,,,,"B.A., Economics",Washington and Lee University,FALSE,,45898,https://www.linkedin.com/company/45898/,urn:li:fsd_company:45898,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C510BAQEwzBTRLj6gOw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1631301901044?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=D1GwjxNP1WL_yumriuofSWZq10333rywamqec4XVvWQ,,,,,,,,,,,Brooks School,emery@aberdeenadvisors.com,FALSE,May 2009 - Present · 16 yrs 3 mos,1995783,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1995783/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/aberdeenadvisors/,urn:li:fsd_company:1995783,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQEOGZUVZr8kGw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630600496717/aberdeenadvisors_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=z9GZ_WWWXys9Td8PLNB5hB52pRvFEIX9W5DtUjX-sDI,,,"It is a privilege to work with our team of experts and the clients who trust us.

"I have been in the Mortgage industry since 1979; first as an independent broker in my family owned brokerage and in Mortgage wholesale since 1995 for a variety of top-ranked companies.   I specialize in managing relationships with my Mortgage Clients and setting their expectations so they can do so for their clients.  This allows me to continue getting business based on the relationship and not just one transaction.

I take pride in having a complete understanding of my mortgage products and helping my Broker clients understand the process and get the best loan for their client's needs.  I am able to decipher the borrower's situation and help the broker fit them into the available mortgage programs.

The bottom line has always been, to provide my client with a smooth, efficient and predictable experience with a priority on Communication.

As one of the most highly decorated mortgage banking companies in Puerto Rico, Money House is now earning that same trust from our Broker clients in our US mainland markets.

OUR MISSION
•	Handle every loan with honesty and integrity
•	Work closely with Mortgage Originators on Reverse Mortgage Refinance and Purchase loans
•	Provide a “right fit” to our Broker Partners so they can provide their Borrower with the Right options
•	Keep seniors in their homes
•	Help seniors and their families live financially secure lives
•	Provide education and expertise to support our Broker Partners to assist the Borrower in making the right mortgage transaction decisions

OUR COMMITMENT
Money House is committed to families. Why is that important? Because we are a family. As a family-owned business, Money House understands the sensitivity that comes with making big family decisions—like a reverse mortgage.
By committing our best efforts to our Broker Partners, we not only focus on providing exceptional, personalized service to each and every one of our clients—we do so with transparency and a sincere interest in their particular situation.
We pride ourselves in being a fully approved and authorized HUD/FHA Mortgagee, Ginnie Mae issuer of forward (MBS) and reverse (HMBS) mortgage loan securities as well as a servicer of our loans in many cases.
That’s why we do not answer to investors. And why we only answer to our clients and  customers.

OUR TEAM
For nearly 25 years, we have built our reputation on honesty and integrity with our customers and partners alike. Our dedicated teams in Puerto Rico and now, the United States, allow us to provide exceptional service to help our Broker Partners make the best decision possible — for their brokerage and their client's family and financial future.",,textComponent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Moneyhouse · Full-time,National Marketing and Sales Director / Account Executive,FALSE,Jul 2018 - Oct 2020 · 2 yrs 4 mos,,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Central+Florida+Chapter+of+FAMP,,,,Greater Orlando,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Central Florida Chapter of FAMP · Full-time,President,FALSE,Aug 2017 - Dec 2019 · 2 yrs 5 mos,602326,https://www.linkedin.com/company/602326/,,urn:li:fsd_company:602326,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQHx0P7vH7SI3g/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1697698654230/lhfs_tpo_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=yTCBwN7gpTu90RxmrY5UBEdrpkwJUwjS_zDlJjl0k-s,Greater Orlando,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Land Home Financial Services, Inc., Your Preferred Wholesale Lender",Account Executive - Central Florida (Orlando - Tampa - Jacksonville),FALSE,Sep 2016 - Jul 2017 · 11 mos,,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=PRMG+Inc%2E,,,,Greater Orlando,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PRMG Inc.,"Loan Officer, NMLS 211801",FALSE,Apr 2015 - Aug 2016 · 1 yr 5 mos,1293791,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1293791/,urn:li:fsd_company:1293791,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C510BAQF4BEXqB3-Xhg/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1631356239528?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=U2VmJegEgmz4gh4-I0zh-ypZ_gn8YDifx_XnmaNTnwI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pacific Union Financial, LLC",Account Executive - Central Florida,David,6801,David Gold,"National Sales Director providing Smooth, Efficient & Predictable service to my B2B Mortgage Originator Clients",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"521,044 followers",LARGE,Executive Coach.

(MBCA is a trade and professional association of 100+  US banks ranging in size from approx. $10Bn to $100Bn in assets). 

What struck me when I first met Jim was his fluid command of the myriad of issues facing midsize banks.  In the context of the MBCA, Jim’s interaction with his peer CROs and CCOs quickly evolved into one of mentor, as he was always generous with his time + willing to assist bankers navigate the most challenging regulatory and balance sheet risk management issues their banks were facing, many of whom were just beginning to mature those disciplines.

Further, Jim was an essential and important voice on numerous legislative lobbying trips to DC and an effective champion for the interests of midsize banks in front of the Nation’s top regulators and key Congressional Members. 

During these meetings Jim’s understanding of the critical role midsize banks played in facilitating the post-Great Recession economic recovery was evident as he convincingly advocated on behalf of his industry.  Jim’s arguments to Washington policymakers were compelling.

My relationship with Jim over the years has continued to grow as he has become a go-to-resource for the MBCA, acting as a sounding board for many MBCA-member bank stakeholders. 

Jim’s judgement is exceptional, his knowledge of the industry is broad, and his pragmatic approach to complex problem solving is exemplary. 

I am fortunate to count on Jim as a partner and hold him in high regard.

"I have a passion for finding creative solutions to providing a better banking experience for traditional and non-traditional customers alike. Technology should never take the place of customer service but enhance a positive experience that makes life better. 

When I became CEO of Surety Bank in 2009, it was during the worst economy our country had seen in decades. We came up with innovative solutions to not only survive the storm but to thrive. 

I am excited for a new season of leadership as we look to the future and enter a digital banking landscape that will provide the very best banking products to give our customers the best experience possible.

"I lead two companies that help businesses make smarter, faster decisions—with data at the center of both.

At Dark Sky Data (www.darkskydata.com), we help VSC and home warranty marketers and administrators, lenders, and private equity firms turn messy spreadsheets into instant insight. Our tools transform raw data into time-aligned visuals that show what’s working, where margin is leaking, and how customer behavior unfolds over time. Whether you’re tracking cancellations, paydown curves, or marketing response, we help you get answers fast—no models, no formulas, no IT.

As CEO and Managing Director of Colonnade Advisors (www.coladv.com), I lead a specialized investment bank focused on mergers and acquisitions in the business and financial services industries. Over the years, we’ve completed nearly $11 billion in M&A transactions, representing founders, private equity firms, and strategic buyers.

After executing with relentless focus, passion, drive, and persistence, with now over 200 open deals and scaling transaction flow into the hundreds of billions, we are proud to announce that Equiturn has formally launched its Foundational Institutional #capital raise.

This is the only time primary #equity participation will be offered ahead of our next phase: full platform monetization, fund architecture activation, and global capital markets expansion.

We are now raising up to $250 million in aggregate commitments from a select group of partners, with no minimum investment requirement. This capital round is reserved for those who see what we see: the convergence of velocity, infrastructure, and institutional credibility.

This isn’t capital for growth. It’s capital to institutionalize a legacy.

Equiturn’s platform today spans an integrated ecosystem of operating entities, each built for precision execution across regulated and non-regulated verticals:

▪️Zeno Citium Global Securities
▪️MJ Toro Global Securities
▪️Equiturn Sports & Entertainment Capital
▪️Equiturn Alpha
▪️Equiturn Asset Management 
▪️Equiturn Business Solutions
▪️Equiturn Air
▪️Equiturn Mega Alpha Fund I
▪️EQ+R Alpha Fund I 

Our footprint includes New York, Miami, Boston, Fort Lauderdale, and Las Vegas, with London, Dubai, Amsterdam, and Monaco next to activate.

To the sovereign allocators, family offices, HNWI/UHNWI, and institutional funds who’ve watched this platform emerge and asked when the right entry point might come:

At Equiturn, every transaction is more than just a deal - it’s a life-changing moment. Behind every placement, M&A transaction, and structured financing, there’s a founder realizing their life’s work, a company securing its future, and families gaining the financial stability to build a better tomorrow.

For us, this isn’t just investment banking. It’s a mission.

That mission has propelled us to hundreds of billions in capital placement deal flow, proving that impact and scale are not mutually exclusive. And now, we’re bringing that same disruptive, high-performance ethos to the sports and entertainment industry.

Equiturn Sports & Entertainment Capital – Changing the Game

With the launch of Equiturn Sports & Entertainment Capital, headquartered in Las Vegas under the leadership of Marcus Banks, we are redefining the financial landscape for professional teams, leagues, and media empires.

Backed by a syndicate of tier-one capital partners - including leading institutions, ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI), multi-family offices (MFOs), family offices (FOs), and sovereign wealth funds - we are delivering unmatched capital access and groundbreaking deal structuring in one of the fastest-growing financial sectors in the world.

And we’re already breaking records - actively working on the behalf of ~25 professional sports enterprises across 14 leagues, financing 5 feature films, and partnering with some of the largest music empires on the planet - all with an average IOI turnaround of ~1 week.

From stadium financings and franchise acquisitions to media rights securitization and athlete wealth structuring, we’re executing unprecedented deals that traditional banks can’t touch. This is investment banking at the highest level - where financial strategy meets cultural impact, and where we don’t just move capital - we shape the future of global sports and entertainment.

🔹 Bigger. Smarter. Faster.
🔹 The future of sports finance is here.
🔹 Welcome to Equiturn Sports & Entertainment Capital.

Looking back all these years to get to this personal milestone, the journey was never about waiting for the perfect moment. It was about showing up every single day, pushing to the absolute limits of sanity, and being delusional enough to believe we could make it work no matter what.  That kind of belief - unyielding, relentless, and aggressively tiring, is what now turns some of my smaller dreams into a reality.

You have to believe in yourself in the best of times, but also in the darkest of times, because that is what creates the brightest of moments. And for me, this one will serve as just that.

"With over 33 years of experience in consumer and business banking, I am a results-driven executive adept at developing and executing effective strategies. Since beginning my credit union career, I have enhanced member experiences by improving online and mobile banking systems, streamlining the loan process, and boosting employee engagement. My leadership transformed our credit union, turning a negative ROA into a positive one. I engage regularly with State and Federal Representatives to promote and protect the small credit union movement. As a graduate of the National Credit Union Foundation’s Credit Union Development Education (DE) Training, I am committed to the credit union movement, funding a scholarship for others to attend the training. I have served as President of the League of Southeastern Credit Union Gulf Coast Chapter and continue as a board chairman. I served on the CUNA Mutual Select Credit Union Council 2022-2024 and as a board member for CU South.
 I deeply believe in the credit union slogan ""people serving people,"" and this was powerfully illustrated when a Category 5 hurricane devastated our local communities. My leadership allowed us to provide critical services and support to our members and neighbors during the crisis, demonstrating the true spirit of our mission. At CLCU, we are dedicated to making a positive impact, and I am proud to be part of this incredible journey.",United States,"Blountstown, Florida, United States","Blountstown, Florida",1950,Banking,linkedin.com/company/calhoun-liberty-credit-union,Calhoun Liberty Credit Union,Nov-50,,2661,,,,,,,,,,,,,11 yrs 7 mos,11.58,FALSE,,163849,https://www.linkedin.com/company/163849/,urn:li:fsd_company:163849,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQE_LSlPkUbFUw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1721069078027/florida_state_university_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=Yv33jcDgnse4rutlAmW-hZVHzZxc8tYBb7TBdGTR35Q,,,,,,,,,Bachelor's degree,Florida State University,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Florida School of Banking,,FALSE,Jan 2014 - Present · 11 yrs 7 mos,95066393,https://www.linkedin.com/company/95066393/,,urn:li:fsd_company:95066393,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQH-SBjPOsY-Og/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1707938832631/calhoun_liberty_credit_union_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=CYBW9tjLbjhrqRPP31q0o60PF-N4Vsu1vC6W7ismrrM,"Blountstown, Fl ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Calhoun Liberty Credit Union · Full-time,Chief Executive Officer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Flowers,2663,Flowers Thomas,"CEO at Calhoun Liberty Credit Union, CUDE, CUNA Mutual Select CU Council Member 2022-24, CU South Board Chairperson.

Cambios positivos eso sí, gracias a Dios. 😅 🤗 🙏 

Ahora tengo el gusto en anunciar formalmente un nuevo y gigantesco paso e invitarles a conocerlo de cerca. 🚀 🚀 🚀 

Desde Orlando - FL - estoy a cargo de la expansión de Shieldfy  en Latinoamérica y, entre los Q2 y Q3 de 2024, lo estaremos lanzando simultáneamente en Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina y Colombia. 

Desde el Q4 se espera México y toda Centroamérica. A veeeerrrrrr....

Les invito a que descarguen la PPT y nos sigan en las redes sociales, principalmente acá en Linked In que la estamos creando para LATAM. Todo es muy nuevo aun en Latinoamérica, con mucho por hacer, pero infinitas oportunidades.

Cuento con todos ustedes para feedbacks y, claro, para que consuman de la mejor plataforma de Ciberseguridad para Hogares y PYMEs de la región!!! 😋 

Shieldfy 

Vamos con todo...

"I started Dynasty Financial Partners for one simple reason, to improve the financial advisor model by building a service platform that allows advisors to do more for clients, grow their business more efficiently, and minimize conflict.

For advisors considering owning their own RIA, the road to independence and business ownership does not have to involve sleepless nights or fear. For advisors who currently run their own RIA but want to grow their business’s efficiency through outsourcing, Dynasty provides solutions to streamline virtually all aspects of their business. Dynasty, along with the Dynasty Network and resource partners, offers a unique and powerful community that promotes collaborating, partnering, investing in proprietary technology, sharing of best practices, unique access and scale that benefits all Network firms and their clients.

At Dynasty, we get to live our American Dream by empowering others to live theirs! It is our great honor to service our network of clients. Please feel free to contact me directly to learn more about Dynasty and our Network of truly exceptional independent advisors.

IDOM was growing in helping banks with projects and developing software.  By 1998, we realized we needed a person to run Human Services as we could not handle the increased load of priorities.  We need someone with the knowledge to set up and run the Human Resources department properly, create policies and procedures, and take care of payroll, reviews, and all the required tasks that HR would handle.

After interviewing many individuals, we hired Tom Hachtel to take on the job.  He set up the entire process of maintaining the payroll, developing personnel procedures, creating an employee handbook, and employee reviews.  With him, we gained as my business partner, and my background was more focused on accounting and operations as a former banker.  Our goal was to get business.

Tom did a fabulous job, and when he relocated out of New Jersey, even though we were sad he was leaving, his procedures and quality of work helped us find someone who could follow in his footsteps. We always stayed in touch, and we are still in touch.

"I build what doesn’t exist, scale what’s stuck, and lead teams through growth that lasts.

As a founder, operator, lending and fintech executive, I’ve launched ventures, revived struggling teams, and architected strategies that have driven billions in loan originations and millions in revenue. From AI-powered automation to high-growth SaaS platforms, I bring a rare blend of entrepreneurial instinct, operational discipline, and product innovation.

Whether in a startup or enterprise environment, my focus is the same:
Identify high-impact opportunities. Build the strategy. Execute relentlessly. Scale fast and smart.

Notable wins along the way:

- Founded and sold a SaaS lending platform acquired by an Inc. 500 company

- Built the first AI chatbot trained on SBA SOP + credit policy

- Led a company through 8x growth during the pandemic, earning top workplace honors

- Scaled SBA lending ops from start-up to thousands of closings per year with proprietary software

I'm currently the COO of a fast-growing business lending platform, while also serving as Founder and CEO of multiple ventures in AI and fintech. I thrive where others hesitate, at the intersection of ambiguity, innovation, and execution.

"My career path was a unique one, leading me from big corporate America on Wall Street to the transition of entrepreneurship, having founded several credit card processing companies.  In the late ‘80s/early ‘90s, I worked at Lehman Brothers’ Investment Banking Group; my landmark project was selling the iconic Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. Although my time on Wall Street was successful, I desired more — specifically, to become an entrepreneur.   

While working 80-100 hours a week, I created Spectoculars, a paper folding binocular.  The NFL purchased 250,000 units for Super Bowl XXX which was the launch of my first venture.

Charge Card Systems (CCS), my first payments company, grew to over 500 sales agents with regional offices throughout the USA.  In 2012, the business was sold to Card Connect.  Following the sale, I continued as president of our division and, in 2017, the company was acquired by First Data for $750 million.

Today, I have a great management team to help manage my different payment processing companies and in 2024,  I’m very excited with the launch of our new company FamVault.

In addition to my payments career, I enjoy public speaking and writing - I have  written and published six business books, including “Size Doesn’t Matter – Why Small Business is BIG Business"" which hit #1 on Amazon's bestseller list in the entrepreneur and business categories.",United States,"Boca Raton, Florida, United States","Boca Raton, Florida",2012,Banking,linkedin.com/company/shavitz-group,Shavitz Group | Explaining The Confusing World Of Payment Processing,Nov-50,shavitzgroup.com,4789,,,,,,,,,,,,,26 yrs 7 mos,26.58,FALSE,,157341,https://www.linkedin.com/company/157341/,urn:li:fsd_company:157341,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQH_656Vr-3pxA/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1631326600841?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=3oWS-JmwusBZDAV2h10ERyAQ2cqB9n_i1gMYN5t95bM,,,,,,,,,"BA of Economics, Accounting and Finance",Tufts University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,jeff@shavitzgroup.com,FALSE,1999 - Present · 26 yrs 7 mos,29021260,https://www.linkedin.com/company/29021260/,,urn:li:fsd_company:29021260,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQE3ud6VhmgMrQ/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1631374075392/shavitz_group_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=CJahOrlyDm3m8pWYim12O4GqnaigO6hD2jdjtQqe-RQ,,,"Shavitz Group - parent company for my payment processing and merchant services businesses that include:

"After 35 years of innovation in global infrastructure investment, I am a visionary in impact investment, creating abundance for diverse communities. For over thirty years, I have worked as an investment banker, specializing in designing long-term capital structures for infrastructure projects in emerging markets. My portfolio includes various asset classes such as transportation, logistics, telecommunications, utilities, energy, oil & gas, mining, and industrial sectors. Additionally, I have expertise in social infrastructure, including health, education, justice, social housing, and sports & entertainment. 

I defied convention by skillfully combining interdisciplinary tools such as selective stakeholder involvement, strategic risk management, credit enhancement instruments, and financial guarantee engineering. Through this approach, I consistently discovered investment opportunities with the growth potential typical of emerging markets, but with significantly reduced risk. 

Over the past decade, I have transformed my focus towards a new and revolutionary approach, impact investment, through GIA. This innovative strategy is based on the belief that infrastructure investment should serve two purposes: generating economic gain and fostering social and environmental prosperity. 

With my extensive background, I have redefined financial structures to maximize their impact on the communities they serve. This has involved transforming traditional business models to be more efficient and effective. My mantra is simple yet profound: minimal cost and maximum impact. This focus on efficiency embodies the success of my vision and marks a promising pathway forward for the investment world, as well as for global prosperity as a whole.

"Each day I look forward to leading our group at Instant Financial to assure we are strengthening relationships and improving the lives for those we serve.  I consider each day a good day if we have done our best to understand our clients and communicate the value we can provide through creative solutions to challenges faced by businesses, while improving access for employees within those businesses. 

I have been fortunate during my career to be involved with innovative people and businesses that have developed solutions which have improved the lives of millions employees across several thousand clients.  We developed a team that first transformed payment access by creating the first payroll debit card for employees who were still receiving paper checks, and who did not have access to the valued banking and digital payments environment.  Novel at the time, this enabled employers to move to 100% direct deposit for the first time, while assuring employees had free access to electronic payments.  Some of my most meaningful business and personal relationships were built, as we were developing the path to electronic pay.

Today, I lead the team at Instant to assure we deliver another solution that positively transforms the business environment for our employers and provides each employee access to their wages at no cost, when they want it, where they want it and how they want it.  In all that I do, I seek to create opportunities for may family, friends, clients, partners and business associates so that in some way, we create a better day for all.

My focus on our Instant team and our clients is based on many of the leadership tenets I learned during my time as a pilot in the United States Marine Corps.  We always seek responsibility and accept responsibility for our actions.  We trust, but verify the details that impact our clients, and we always seek to serve those who depend on us for our pay, before our selves.",United States,Pensacola Metropolitan Area,Pensacola Metropolitan Area,2015,Financial Services,linkedin.com/company/instant-financial,Instant Financial,Nov-50,instant.co,2944,,,,,,,,,,,,,4 yrs 4 mos,4.33,FALSE,,10804999,https://www.linkedin.com/company/10804999/,urn:li:fsd_company:10804999,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQEuZIH32TU7sw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1631330493859?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=ewjw5HiqwKfQugRmchf2x-gLpYd3OMM6m7a_kV1y3bM,,,,,,,,,MBA,University of San Francisco School of Management,FALSE,,10413,https://www.linkedin.com/company/10413/,urn:li:fsd_company:10413,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQGePSP7sPgaAw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630434086527/mississippi_state_university_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=RtRcGykjenFs9fH3Ui7_R_oXSoRQBfteKpg-TW89_8g,Activities and societies: Sigma Alpha Epsilon,,insightComponent,,,,,,,"BS, Agricultural Engineering Technology and Business",Mississippi State University,tal.clark@instant.co,FALSE,Apr 2021 - Present · 4 yrs 4 mos,10286726,https://www.linkedin.com/company/10286726/,,urn:li:fsd_company:10286726,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEy8wiALSM-rQ/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1724716992977/instant_financial_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=7jr5GBn9EbydcmKrntNuWyU_AOc1WVrAcyx0uh7j8HE,"Pensacola, Florida, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Instant Financial · Full-time,Chief Executive Officer,FALSE,Jun 2019 - Present · 6 yrs 2 mos,36945762,https://www.linkedin.com/company/36945762/,,urn:li:fsd_company:36945762,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQGUz5b1xIJDgg/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630570909442/coflyt_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=tcn-3pH8jG6Q5S9FDthf3achdJ4RuElG7_nMiG3C-PQ,"Pensacola, Florida",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coflyt™,Co-Founder and Board Member,FALSE,Jul 2018 - Present · 7 yrs 1 mo,28978059,https://www.linkedin.com/company/28978059/,,urn:li:fsd_company:28978059,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQHdZSzdRN8-KA/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630591788943/knwn_technologies_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=h4Zj3mFS4jiLv6LBS1oVlkJofU4LM6r_ZWlMZMafvvE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,KNWN Technologies,Advisory Board Member,TRUE,,2020,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2020/,,urn:li:fsd_company:2020,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQHFrlmn7_hS-w/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630564881691/first_data_corporation_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=-ojyJrxXvf7Iwi2XMuZU7JCW0G_qA_keLaCsZaJXd8Q,,Oct 2016 - Aug 2018 · 1 yr 11 mos,"Complete responsibility for Open Loop Prepaid at First Data including full P&L responsibility.

Glen is one of those rare individuals who has the analytic capabilities and management talent to build successful businesses -- both for his clients, partners, and for himself.  A hard-working, tireless, and relentless professional with the absolute dedication to ""getting it done,"" he gets the best performance from others (including me) by delivering it himself.

When it comes to investment insight and the ability to rapidly ""read"" a business, he had a clarity of vision that enable him to advise and direct his clients -- and importantly, to know when to steer clear of those looking to become a portfolio company.  His knowledge of industry areas spans a wide range from fintech to consumer, from marketing analytics to CPG -- and in the few areas Glen might be unfamiliar with an aspect of a business, he always knows where to go to get the answers.  Effectively and efficiently.

To close, it is not only the business attributes that make Glen an exceptional person.

"I am an enthusiastic, results and customer-oriented senior quality specialist, offering extensive global experience managing projects on committed delivery plan, while assuring high level of quality standards.

I managed during 14+ years a business providing high quality packaging products for the main and most demanding international pharmaceutical companies. I created since then, a strong sense of company ownership while managing different projects and acquired a vast knowledge of all aspects of an organization.

Basically it's a system that all issuing and acquiring banks will have to connect to by the end of 2022. Currently over 90 to 95% of issuing program banks are currently connected, and by the end of 2022 it will be mandatory for all VISA merchants, processors and acquirers.  This also includes the RDR and CDRN chargeback elimination systems as well.

This system monitors inquiries that occur POST transaction. When a customer issues an inquiry regarding a specific transaction or transactions, and while still on the telephone with a customer support representative at their issuing bank, there is a 10 second window that Visa allows, during which the existence of the transaction is confirmed and a resolution can be declared in real time.  

The alert, confirmation, and resolution is routed directly through VISAnet via the FRAUDdefender system. The response for high chargeback merchants will typically always be that the merchant is initiating a credit (refund).

All of this occurs within a window of 10 seconds after a customer inquiry, disputes will be resolved in real time, rather than the typical pattern where chargebacks show up at the acquirer 3 weeks after the customer makes a dispute.

Now, we are focused on the future of Cash Management.   C C & D is focused on maintaining and creating partnerships with our customers by providing leading-edge Cash Management products designed to automate the handling and accounting of cash in the most efficient manner possible.  

Why C C & D?

2. PEOPLE WHO CARE: Our family business has attracted technical staff that do more than just fix machines.

During a recent flight, I had a conversation with someone who was selling their company and was incredulous that he had to leave behind working capital as part of the transaction. 

I asked him why that was so upsetting? His response was, “I should be getting paid for my business and I should get to keep all my working capital.”

My response, “When you rent a car, don’t you expect the car to be full of gas when you drive out of the rental car location? Do you think the airline we are flying today should sell us a ticket, then, when we board, collect more money for jet fuel?” Of course, his response was “No, that’s included in the price of the rental car or the price of my plane ticket.”

Well, it is the same when buying your business. The buyer expects there to be fuel in the tank on the day they take over. The buyer does not pay you a multiple of EBITDA, then add more money to the deal to operate the business on day 1. 

The buyer, by paying a multiple of EBITDA, is also buying your balance sheet, and therefore is acquiring your working capital. 
When a buyer is considering purchasing your company, they expect the company to have a certain level of working capital in order to continue operating smoothly and meet its financial obligations. 

The buyer will want to see that the company has enough cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets to cover its current liabilities. Some of the key components of working capital include:
Cash and cash equivalents
Accounts receivable
Inventory
Accounts payable

To determine your company's working capital requirements, you will need to consider how much of these assets and liabilities you will need to maintain to continue operating your business. For example, if you operate a business that requires you to hold large amounts of inventory, your working capital requirements will be higher than a business that does not require a significant amount of inventory. 
 
 The quick math to determine your approximate working capital as you go into a deal is: Current Assets – Cash -Current Liabilities. This quick calculation will give you a snapshot of how much you will potentially be required to leave behind as part of the transaction.

This is an area where many M&A transactions run into trouble simply because the Seller does not understand how deals are structured and they have the erroneous thought that even after getting a multiple of EBITDA for their Company, they still expect to also walk away with their entire balance sheet.

What is it?

I rarely have a conversation while on a plane and discussing mergers and acquisitions without the question of EBITDA arising. 

Many CEO’s have heard the term, but few really understand why buyers use 𝗘𝗕𝗜𝗧𝗗𝗔 𝘃𝘀. 𝗡𝗲𝘁 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲.

Since there is still some confusion around the topic, I decided to break it down by category to help arm you with key elements you need to know about EBITDA.

For starters, let’s focus on answering the following topics:

1. What is EBITDA?
2. How do you calculate EBITDA?
3. What is the rationale behind EBITDA?
4. What are the drawbacks of EBITDA?

 
Let’s dig into each one of these further in the carousel.

Full disclosure: All my answers are taken from personal experience and have been supplemented by sources such as BDC and Investopedia.

I had the pleasure of working with Jim for several years, when I held the position of Vice President of Implementation and Support at Wescom Resources Group.

In his role as an Implementations Engineer, Jim was responsible for the implementation of our Online Banking Application - a complex task that demanded proficiency in multiple technical fields. His tasks encompassed networking, server administration, and a thorough understanding of the Symitar Core. Moreover, he demonstrated an excellent ability to troubleshoot complicated issues, and his consistent focus on detail and deadlines ensured our projects were completed smoothly and on time.

One of Jim's most valuable skills was his knack for project management. He managed to juggle his technical responsibilities and project management with an effortless grace that truly set him apart. Not only was he able to ensure that projects were completed according to schedule, but he also expertly managed stakeholder expectations, proactively addressed issues and communicated effectively with all members of our team. This impressive balance demonstrated his versatility and commitment to excellence.

During his time with us, Jim's diligence, technical acumen, and unwavering commitment to quality were apparent to everyone who worked with him. His ability to integrate various skills and navigate complex projects was a driving force behind many of our successes. His willingness to go the extra mile, coupled with his consistent professional development, made him an indispensable member of our team.

I am confident that Jim will continue to be very successful and will make a significant contribution to any team. If you're looking for someone who is dedicated, technically skilled, and with great project management capabilities, I recommend Jim Varoutas without any reservations.

Dave has a very entrepreneurial spirit, and is one of the most connected people I know in the banking industry.  Through one of his contacts, he has opened the door for me to begin the discussions on a very large deal with the the Management of a bank holding company.  Through another one of his contacts, he has opened the door to another company that is interested in selling our software to large banks.
 
There are many character qualities I like about Dave.  First of all, I don't think you will find a more honest salesman.  I've seen him turn down a very lucrative deal because he didn't think the company he was representing could deliver the features the prospect wanted.  Secondly, he has the persistence to seek out new prospects, and the drive to follow up -- both qualities of a good salesman.  Thirdly, well, he's just a likeable guy!

"With 30+ years of experience, I’ve transformed banks, fintech ventures, and PE-backed platforms from $300M community institutions to multi-billion-dollar enterprises and global financial institutions.

My career began at GE, where I rose to senior leadership and led a $2B commercial lending business by age 28. Earned certification as a GE Six Sigma Master Black Belt, recognized for driving enterprise-wide, data-informed transformation with a focus on operational efficiency. Since then, I’ve led growth, regulatory remediation, and enterprise modernization across Fortune 500s, fintech pioneers, and institutions regulated by the FRB, OCC, and FDIC.

A hands-on, execution first leader, I bring a pragmatic approach to innovation grounded in operational excellence, regulatory credibility, and strategic impact.

I’m passionate about the mission of community banking—where customer centricity, disciplined execution, and emerging technology intersect.

I designed a real-time digital command center, now powering AI-driven crypto settlement and blockchain-based transaction routing. This eliminates legacy friction and enables secure, scalable infrastructure.

I’ve launched trust banks and asset management platforms, embedded finance solutions, and revitalized distressed institutions to drive long-term value creation.

"Get a FREE guide to learn how to instantly form a fund or syndication by going to Raises.com/linkedin

Real estate syndicators and business buyers who haven't raised above $1m are working way too hard raising small amounts of capital and netting tiny profit margins from their acquisitions or funds. 

Picture this: closing a $10m+ multifamily acquisition or fund, and having a team under you that helps you compliantly raise funds from accredited investors, netting profit margins on a larger deal for you to do the next one.

That’s what most talk about, yet cease to ever accomplish...

After servicing multiple offerings and raising $150m+, 

 I've noticed a pattern of why most minor dealmakers haven’t ""graduated"" to $10m+ multifamily acquisitions or business buyouts. I've distilled it down to 3 key broken systems:

System #1. Setup — You Don't know how to set up the legal/financials/securities to raise $10m+. 

Without this setup system, there is a risk of non-compliance fines and litigation.

System #2. Mandate — No systems in place to know the investor mandates

Without knowing what investors want before you setup your offering you're gambling by paying lawyers to build expensive PPMs for unfundable deals. You risk paying six figures  to a securities attorney to build your fund or offering just for your deal not to raise a single cent.

System #3. Outreach — Limited by having no processes to get it happening all for you

Don't have the network, relationships and systems to actually close large equity investors (they don't know one person in real life qualified to invest)

Now, if you're facing any of these broken systems, I have good news! These are completely avoidable and reversible if you just follow the right process. 

At Raises.com, we are client-obsessed helping entrepreneurs succeed by building these systems.

At Raises.com, you can swiftly prepare your new real estate fund, rolls-ups, or acquisitions in as little as 2-weeks, then begin to raise $10 million+ for all while joining a new movement of founders saving months of time and millions of dollars in the process. (Ex-executives from J.P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch, KPMG, Standard Bank, US Federal Election Commission, Slate Street. Including founders at Roofing.com, 99Homes, and the US Housing Exchange have raised millions)

My vision was, and continues to be, not just about structuring deals; it was about earning the trust of clients, navigating complex negotiations, and adapting to market shifts. 

Based on these principles, Latam Investment Banking was founded to bring tailored financial solutions to businesses in the Americas. My goal was to leverage my investment banking track record working in New York and Latin America to pursue this new opportunity.

I appreciate my clients who believed in this vision, the high-impact transactions that helped companies scale, and, of course, the difficult moments that tested our resilience.

This journey has been one of growth, learning, and transformation, and none of it would have been possible without the trust of our clients, the dedication of our team, and the strong relationships built along the way.

As we celebrate this milestone, I look forward to continuing to support businesses in the Americas in navigating strategic decisions, unlocking new opportunities, and shaping the investment landscape in the region.

"I’m the founder of Davison Holdings, where we don’t just acquire properties—we transform them.

Over the past two decades, I’ve focused on distressed assets in the manufactured housing and single-family rental (SFR) space. Through Davison Holdings, I source, develop, and reposition communities and portfolios across Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and California. Whether it’s a 50-space manufactured home park or a 300-home SFR package, I approach every project with hands-on oversight and a clear goal: improve the asset, build community value, and deliver strong returns.

My expertise lies in evaluating underperforming properties, managing full-scope rehabs, navigating tricky compliance issues (including FLDEP and zoning), and bringing teams together to get projects done—on time and under budget. I’ve worked with cities, state agencies, contractors, designers, and investors to take properties from neglected to thriving.

Through Davison Holdings and partnerships with firms like EquiAlt and Escal8Build, I’ve built a track record of uncovering upside where others might not look—and executing with integrity.",United States,"Tampa, Florida, United States","Tampa, Florida",2022,Investment Banking,linkedin.com/company/equialt,Brian,10-Jan,icashflow.com,16283,FALSE,,,,"B.S.

"Shelly Berensen is an industry-leading payment processing solutions executive in the industry for over 25 years and the CEO of Specialized Processing Systems.  During her exciting career in this industry dominated by mega-banks, Shelly has lead a team of astute business process development professionals, highly skilled computer programmers and system engineers, allowing her to develop one of the most highly advanced payment processing platforms in the industry.

“The Platform”

Leveraging the latest technologies available in the 21st century, Specialized Processing Solutions has developed “The Platform” – leaps and bounds ahead of the technology of the 1970s payment processing platforms in use by the majority of merchants across the globe.  These outdated platforms are inefficient and not flexible, prohibiting most merchants from receiving the best possible processing rate on each individual transaction.  

Bringing UnionPay to the Masses

Shelly Berensen and Specialized Processing Solutions have worked for over three years in partnership with China Union Pay (CUP) to develop a 100% reliable processing solutions.  In the world, CUP branded cards outnumber Visa branded cards.  Most merchants in the US don’t even accept UnionPay, blocking the 3.5 billion cardholders from conducting transactions with US merchants.  Now, in a marketing partnership, Shelly Berensen is leading the way for an increased level of acceptance of UnionPay in the United States with CUP provided SMS, web and in-statement marketing of newly acquired merchants.",United States,"Boca Raton, Florida, United States","Boca Raton, Florida",2008,Banking,linkedin.com/company/specialized-processing-solutions,Specialized Processing Solutions,Nov-50,specializedprocessingsolutions.com,864,,,,,,,,,,,,,18 yrs 7 mos,18.58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sb@specializedprocessingsolutions.com,FALSE,2007 - Present · 18 yrs 7 mos,3631231,https://www.linkedin.com/company/3631231/,,urn:li:fsd_company:3631231,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQGXRlf8AX3VMg/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1631336652277?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=gSOhrXtI14Vjceu1zpiyR5-VbCPaEGVH474Wo3fi3XA,Miami/Fort Lauderdale Area,,"Founder, President and CEO of the most advanced 21st century payment processing systems company with unique and proprietary features providing merchants with greater ability to manage their business, enjoy the lowest processing rates possible, and have access to new markets and customers.",,textComponent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Specialized Processing Solutions,President and CEO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shelly,894,Shelly Berensen,President CEO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1,754,077 followers",LARGE,Founder of The Honest Company,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-alba,Jessica Alba,,,,,,Top Voices,"4,240,420 followers",LARGE,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1241/,HSBC,"2,899,447 followers",LARGE,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1262/,Deutsche Bank,Companies,"61,996 members",LARGE,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/groups/64064,Payments Strategy,"5,868 members",LARGE,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3821959,Payment Transformation Innovations,Groups,Published weekly,LARGE,https://www.linkedin.com/in/scarlettsieber,Scarlett Sieber,A weekly breakdown of the latest tech trends and insights from thought leaders shaping the future of tech.,https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/6506994987987726336,Tech Tuesday,,,,,,,,Newsletters,,,,,,,,,,President and CEO,,,,,,,Berensen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/shellyberensen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQEyKdIKgIP-wQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0/1516607975458?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=-JXoHrMuJwGXKUa1pGsrFO3SZ55fuoeHseUqiQI160k,100,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQEyKdIKgIP-wQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0/1516607975458?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=-JXoHrMuJwGXKUa1pGsrFO3SZ55fuoeHseUqiQI160k,100,200,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQEyKdIKgIP-wQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1516607975576?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=teRlMrEsENff-uoLbJdr3VFATVXepZ9nUHMJpb1IXGI,200,300,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQEyKdIKgIP-wQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1516607975492?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=PlMjY6NKOC-085WzciP_XOzTTzWYqRtejS4qXoMC0vA,300,300,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQEyKdIKgIP-wQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1516607975442?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=dbEtEoYKtuiZ6wCx3FlRVqubXptJCjWrMweHOeaoCfI,300,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQEyKdIKgIP-wQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1516607975492?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=PlMjY6NKOC-085WzciP_XOzTTzWYqRtejS4qXoMC0vA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,shellyberensen,,,,,,,,,,,"July 23, 2013, Michael A. worked with Shelly but on different teams",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQHmoNZB5V2yTg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/B56Zcmu1qpHEAU-/0/1748701503657?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=j-qOKcd_sGWKmxhA-X0GFE3yidTw6QBclYe6XEit-BU,LARGE,"Shelly and I have worked on several projects over the past 6 years, in the payment space of merchant services and debit card payroll opportunities.

"Storm is ranked one of the top 5 Tech M&A bankers of all time (VentureBeat 2024), one of the Top 50 M&A Dealmakers in the World (Atlas M&A Award 2024), and is a winner of the 2024 ”M&A Leadership Award” as well as multiple M&A and Growth Financing Deal of the Year awards.  He has executed 2 of the top 10 ranked M&A deals of all time (Business Insider), and is the founder of Ignatious (VentureBeat top 5 Tech M&A Boutique, and Atlas 2024 Technology Boutique Investment Bank of the Year), an investment bank focused on the AI future (horizontal / generative AI, vertical / applied AI and agentic AI, as well as previously established technology companies across all sectors transitioning to an AI future).

Storm has advised many of the most iconic companies and defining transactions in the technology sector, and served as primary strategic advisor to Google for a decade, including the highest returning acquisition in history (YouTube) and DoubleClick amongst many others. He sold MySQL to Sun, and then sold Sun to Oracle; sold Apple its first full stack autonomous vehicle company; sold Tinder to Match; merged Careem with Uber (Global Deal of the Year); secured AMD’s future leadership in CPUs with the sale of Nexgen; sold Netfish for $270mm two days before filing for bankruptcy; led the only equity recovery ever for a software company in bankruptcy (Peregrine), and sold AOL the first DARPANet node, amongst many other groundbreaking transactions.

His top five ranked tech advisory firm, Ignatious, focuses exclusively on capturing extraordinary financial outcomes for emerging growth technology companies, their visionary leaders, and the investors that support them by aligning these great companies with the best strategic and financial partners through Ignatious' unmatched M&A and private capital raising expertise.

Prior to Ignatious, Storm lead two of the top Technology investment banks and served as CEO/Co-founder of three startups in the technology space, including an award winning venture-backed start-up spun out of MIT.  He has managed businesses ranging in size from startups to $1bb of annual revenue, founded 3 new corporate divisions with over $500 mm of annual revenue, and grew a declining mature division over 400% in less than 5 years.

Storm is a frequent speaker and panelist at technology, M&A and mobility/transportation conferences, was the #1 ranked Jefferies Podcaster, a guest lecturer at Harvard Law School and Stanford University, and co-authored and co-taught a course on mergers and acquisitions at Stanford Law School.",United States,"Miami, Florida, United States","Miami, Florida",2022,Financial Services,linkedin.com/company/ignatious,Ignatious,Nov-50,ignatious.com,10799,,,,,,,,,,,,,3 yrs 7 mos,3.58,FALSE,1988 - 1992,15248569,https://www.linkedin.com/company/15248569/,urn:li:fsd_company:15248569,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQGGJUjGgSYcWQ/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1631385636084?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=I69IMWJ1ECMIrEejQ3olpdUBR33V9DWZOzKCKw2Mt3g,Activities and societies: Yale Political Union; Tory Club; Sigma Chi,,insightComponent,"Class of 1992, Graduated in 1991",,textComponent,,,"B.A., Political Science and American Studies",Yale University,FALSE,1992 - 1994,15100308,https://www.linkedin.com/company/15100308/,urn:li:fsd_company:15100308,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGaTy9bx-um-g/company-logo_100_100/B4EZXuAHDOH0AQ-/0/1743454761470/michiganross_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=IddMFE45owOeY15mQiblsZ53w4RueN6wnf75Ts6zFMY,Graduated With Distinction (Honors),,textComponent,,,,,,,"MBA, Finance",University of Michigan - Stephen M.

"The mission of the ICRG is to help individuals and families affected by gambling disorder and to prevent the onset of gambling problems through high quality scientific research and evidence-based educational programming on gambling disorder and responsible gambling.

As the gaming industry grows and evolves throughout the world, the powerful research of the International Center for Responsible Gaming is driving change and leading the field forward. Since 1996, we have provided independent, peer-reviewed research that helps increase the understanding of gambling harms and find effective methods of mitigation. Our work is impacting public policy, strengthening responsible gambling and improving the health and well-being of the people and communities affected by the continued growth of the industry.

Nearly $40 million has been committed to the ICRG, through contributions from the casino gaming industry, equipment manufacturers, vendors, sports wagering companies, tribal casinos, related organizations and individuals.

Celebrating the launch with friends, family, and colleagues offered a powerful reminder of why I began this journey in the first place. Writing this book wasn’t just about explaining the technical steps of a sale; it was about creating a comprehensive guide that equips owners with the knowledge they need to confidently face what can be an incredibly complex process.

To every business owner out there, I understand the passion, hard work, and persistence you pour into your company. Selling a business is so much more than a transaction—it’s the culmination of years of dedication. My hope is that this book serves as a trusted resource, offering clarity and insight at every step.

Thank you to everyone who made this launch possible and to those who celebrated alongside me. It’s been quite the journey, and I’m excited to see where it leads next.

"20 years ago, Anthony Angelillo moved to Florida to start his illustrious career in the mortgage industry. An inspired entrepreneur, Anthony has been able to enact his dream of streamlining the industry through the use of automated technology to educate clients and get them to the closing table in a timely manner. He is the CEO/Founder of Tag Lending Group and TAGTEAMNATION in Miami, he offers personalized, informative service to clients across Florida.
Anthony understands the importance of ensuring his clients know how to find success within the mortgage sector. By implementing intake forms to gather information from clients (primarily through high-quality video content), Tag Team has the ability to use that information to offer the clients a “Road Map to Homeownership”. “Our proprietary workflow really makes the process easier to handle for a lot of people,” Anthony says. “The mortgage industry doesn’t always do a great job of making itself approachable, so I’ve taken it upon myself to do just that, and I think people really appreciate it.”
Anthony keeps things straight to the point and delivers information to his clients in a prompt and honest manner. “When you work with my branch, there’s no runaround or smoke and mirrors. What you see is what you get,” Anthony says. “The level of transparency we employ is incredibly important in making clients feel at ease and empowering them to make the best possible decisions for themselves and their families.” Offering clarity and direction on a grand scale is Anthony’s MO. He did $60M in total volume last year and with his technology expects to produce at a higher rate in the years to come.
Anthony was awarded Miami’s Top Loan Officer of the Year and featured in Scotsman Guide in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 for being one of the top 1% of originators in the nation. He is the co-host of the award-winning podcast, Damage Control, with Melinda Grimaldi, wherein they have discussions on a number of topics with a variety of guests within the world of real estate, all of which help educate Realtors on the best practices to improve their business.
Anthony got into the mortgage industry primarily as a method to help people – he believes every family has a shot at achieving the American Dream and prides himself on providing a “tag team” approach by working cohesively with Realtors, buyers, listing agents, and title agents. If you’re looking for a Mortgage Officer in Florida/US who excels at coming up with effective solutions specific to his client’s needs, look no further than Anthony Angelillo!",United States,"Miami, Florida, United States","Miami, Florida",2022,Banking,linkedin.com/company/lead-automation-loan-officer-lalo,"Tag Lending Group, Llc",Nov-50,taglendinggroup.com,4946,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.TagLendingGroup.com,www.TagLendingGroup.com,3 yrs 1 mo,3.08,FALSE,1999 - 2003,15090,https://www.linkedin.com/company/15090/,urn:li:fsd_company:15090,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQHgcxtyCUUY7w/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630584331089/university_of_hartford_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=aR7FbjwmMdGxHUcbFSLNxeNZmPqM21zPZBaz7dmXOzY,"Activities and societies: Presidents Council, For The M.I.S Team.

A major contribution to my success correlates with having excellent partners that go above and beyond their call of duty, and provide the level of service that clients demand in this competitive market.  
We all work with a special partner that helps alleviate some of the challenges we face in running a successful operation.  In my case, that would be making referrals to agents and trusting them to deliver on their promise.  I am sure most of us can relate, because in almost any businesses or profession, in order to be successful you have to have everyone working together to achieve a common goal.  No different than any sports team that needs to bond together and have that camaraderie in order to win a championship.

I'm proud to say I have that special partner /Realtor, Ann Rogers.   I am 100% confident that when I refer a client to Ann to handle their real estate transaction.  I know that client is going to be treated with the utmost respect and be provided with the level of service they deserve when making such an important decision in their life (purchasing a home). 
When you deal with a professional like Ann, her clients remain her clients for life.  They appreciate all the effort she puts into listening to them and working so persistently to find them their dream home!  I can tell you, not many people spend the time to listen, but that's what separates Ann. 

Ann is my ""Go to Agent"" when I need someone to take special care of my clients in the Tampa Bay Area.

"As an attorney I practice in both business law and healthcare law. My firm provides exceptional customer service through a unique and cost effective concierge-type program. From small businesses to large healthcare medical practices, each client’s goals and needs frame how we work together. 

At the age of nine, I started working in my family’s business, and experienced all the aspects of starting, building, and running a business. I’ve been a teacher, a teamster, a farmhand, a clerk, a businessman, and a lawyer. I also have the contacts and network to help with almost anything you need.

Not only do health care practices face the challenges of being a business, but they have to deal with malpractice concerns and 10,000 laws and regulations as healthcare providers as well.

Most often I meet at my client’s office so they are not spending otherwise productive time travelling.  My responsive concierge program provides certainty in legal costs, working on a flat fee retainer basis. No one cares more about their clients than I do. My clients can reach me virtually anytime and anywhere. I have negotiated contracts from the top of a mountain in Colorado on a Saturday night while skiing.

We start where you are in your business. Whether it is formation, negotiating contracts, buying or selling, or dispute resolution. My philosophy is to help you do business, to provide you with a road map to success. I help you focus on the big picture while effectively mitigating risks at every level of business, as well as being there to provide representation when and if it is needed. 

Most of my clients had not previously considered the benefits of a concierge attorney arrangement. Please give me a call at 239 220-3326 or send an email to bruce@brucevanderlaan.com, and we can arrange to discuss how and why this might be a perfect solution for your legal needs.

I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve been appointed President & CEO of First National Bank Coastal Community, a privately-held financial institution with locations in South Florida and Georgia.  

I’m looking forward to leading this incredible team of community bankers as we execute our expansion plans.   Together, we will build on the strong foundation already established and create something truly special.

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to William Penney for allowing me the opportunity to serve as Chief Lending Officer at Marine Bank for the past seven years.  We had a great run!  The knowledge and experience I gained will undoubtedly play a crucial role in the journey ahead.  

Of course, I will miss my amazing team.  There are too many of you to name, but your dedication and hard work directly contributed to making this possible.  Thank you for everything—I won’t forget it.  

Another special thank you to Alex Sanchez for encouraging me to think big and consider the possibility of leading my own bank someday. You planted that seed many years ago, and that day has finally arrived—next cafecito is on me!

I’m also excited to rejoin the Florida Bankers Association and begin collaborating with Kathy Kraninger and her team on banking issues that impact Main Street.  I can’t wait to see everyone at the FBA Annual Convention in June.  We’ve got work to do.  

Here’s to new beginnings!  🚀

"Creating and growing the Amida brand has been my sole passion and purpose since 2013. The birth of Amida Wealth, followed by Amida Business Management and Amida Lifestyle has been deeply influenced by my parent’s commitment to positively impacting people’s lives. As a child, I traveled throughout South America and spent summers at camps my father created. It wasn’t until I was grown and in the business world that I realized how much his entrepreneurial spirit influenced the creation of my life canvas and the eventual birth of Amida Wealth. 

A few life lessons I carry with me even today:
• The value of practicing self-care is a lasting impression from my years in the wellness industry.
• The importance of service to others was honed while I was in the hospitality world.
• And from my parents, find a vision, pursue your passions, and follow a path – always leaving our world a little better than we found it.

Amida Wealth and the values I share with my clients are my gift to the world. My years in corporate America inspired me to question the status quo and re-imagine a new way of being. As the founder, I am now re-creating what wealth management can truly become for my clients. It is my firm belief that wealth should be much more than investments and returns. True wealth can serve as the palm tree in an oasis…respite in life. 

Amida embodies the vision of true wealth - a place where, yes, we grow our money through proper investments, tax and legacy strategies but in a way that also provides an enlightening and distinctive experience; a place that allows you to bring harmony into all the areas of life and therefore help you transform your vision of wealth.

"Driven to be of service to my community, to my network, and my clients, because I value the power in connecting challenges to solutions. 

I believe  in collaboration, and the empowerment of others in order to maintain high productivity and performance within a team and organization. 

As the pace of change in buying behavior accelerates, I am a trusted resource for executives to stay ahead of the curve, by providing access to the right intel, solutions and network.  Purpose-driven with a genuine inner passion to be a bridge that provides direct, and efficient access to solutions.   

My specialty is crafting outcome-focused B2B events, that provide access to world-class research and cutting-edge intelligence solutions. I am dedicated to helping businesses meet the challenges posed by the fast-moving, disruptive business environment by creating environments that foster innovative brainstorming and masterminding. 

Whether it’s brokering real solutions to existing or upcoming business projects, providing greater insight into emerging trends and their outcomes, or helping clients cut through the noise of a crowded  vendor marketplace, my experience working with executives, and business owners across the country provides the network and information you need to make projects a success.

Disruption is happening. Business is changing. And having the right combination of intel, timing, and influencers is the new imperative. 

""The natural desire of good men is knowledge.""- Leonardo da Vinci

Besides staying up to date with disruptive technologies and innovative marketing strategy, I am an avid hiker and adventure traveler, public speaker, recreational soccer player, and an uncle to 15 beautiful nieces and nephews.

"With a career dedicated to unlocking U.S. real estate opportunities for international and domestic investors, I’ve had the privilege of leading The Q Kapital Group Corp as CEO & Founder—positioning the firm as one of the top mortgage companies specializing in foreign national loans.

At Q Kapital, we have successfully funded over $8 billion in residential and commercial loans, providing financing solutions tailored to the unique needs of foreign nationals and U.S. citizens alike. From luxury condos in Miami to investment properties in Orlando, Houston, Colorado, and New York, our team has developed a proven expertise in navigating complex transactions with speed, clarity, and personalized service.

But the mission goes beyond mortgages—it’s about building long-term value for our clients and being a reliable partner in their journey to wealth creation through U.S. real estate.

In parallel, I proudly serve as Founder & Board Member of Nexos Invest, a private lending platform created to deliver fast, secure, and structured financing solutions to high-net-worth individuals, developers, and real estate investors. With over $500 million in private capital placed, Nexos Invest fills a vital gap in the market, offering flexible lending where traditional institutions fall short.

"Wealth Advisor at RFG Advisory | Kiplinger contributor.

As a former professional athlete, I’ve seen firsthand how quickly financial success can be undermined without the right guidance. That experience shaped my mission today: to help individuals and families avoid costly mistakes and make confident, informed decisions about their money.

As a dedicated Wealth Advisor, I bring the same focus, discipline, and drive from my athletic career into every client relationship. My approach is rooted in trust — built through transparency, consistent communication, and delivering on my word.

I prioritize accountability and availability, ensuring my clients always have a reliable partner to turn to. Education is a cornerstone of my process. I believe in simplifying complex financial topics and creating a clear connection between you and your investments, so you’re never in the dark about where your money is or how it’s working for you.

Whether you're planning for retirement, growing wealth, or just trying to simplify your financial life, I’ll work with you to build a strategy that’s as dynamic and resilient as your goals.

Let’s build a future with clarity, confidence, and a strong game plan — Winning, Together.

Lauderdale, FL",,"Helping Athletes, Entertainers and Families preserve their income through strategic financial planning. Our goal is to bridge the gap between playing and retirement so that our clients can live the lifestyle they have come accustom to living.

Our Focus:
- Asset Protection and Properly Structured Asset Allocation Strategies
- Risk Management & Mitigation Strategies—Assessment and Implementation
- Private Asset and Principal Protected Methods & Portfolio Management
- Entity/Estate Planning & Titling of Assets—Current Ownership and Beneficiary Designations
- Income Tax Minimization Strategies and Burden/Allocation Planning

A vast number of players never think about putting money away while they’re playing and in certain cases, it’s far too late to play catch up.  Through the years, we’ve heard countless players express concern of the day the lucrative checks stop coming in and we get asked, ”What can I do now?” Our answer is always “Get Started Now”. By creating an asset protection plan and retirement income strategy, we can effectively bridge the gap between the last days of playing and when it comes time to pull from your well-deserved pension fund.

The Sports & Entertainment Division of Global Wealth Management provides personalized, coordinated financial planning and asset protection strategies for professional athletes & entertainers, addressing their tax, investment, insurance, estate and overall wealth management needs. By dissecting the top three areas of most concern—Traditional Asset Protection Strategies, Transparent Institutional-Based Investment Management, and Seamless Generational Wealth Transfer—our experienced team of professional financial advisors guides athletes through the various transitional phases of their life, from amateur to professional, to potential career transition and ultimately, retirement—and puts a plan in place that allows professional athletes to convert their career earnings into a legacy of financial stability.",,textComponent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Global Wealth Management,President - Sports & Entertainment.

Dentro de este proceso de reflexión, decidí darme un regalo especial e invertir en mí, mientras me reconectaba con Colombia desde una perspectiva diferente.
La semana pasada fui muy feliz de graduarme del Curso de Liderazgo de Mujeres en Juntas Directivas, liderado por el Centro de Estudios en Gobierno Corporativo - CESA. Fue una experiencia profundamente enriquecedora, llena de aprendizajes transformadores y la oportunidad de compartir con una comunidad de mujeres excepcionales que inspiran.
Quiero destacar el liderazgo ejemplar de Maria Andrea Trujillo y Alexander Guzmán, quienes están haciendo una labor extraordinaria al promover la conciencia colectiva sobre la importancia del liderazgo femenino y el empoderamiento intergeneracional en Colombia. Es motivador ver cómo iniciativas como estas están abriendo puertas y creando oportunidades para el futuro. Sin duda, este ha sido uno de los mejores regalos que me he dado este año, y me llena de entusiasmo seguir contribuyendo a construir espacios donde más mujeres puedan liderar y generar impacto.

It was a profoundly enriching experience, filled with transformative learning and the opportunity to connect with a community of exceptional women who inspire.
I want to highlight the exemplary leadership of María Andrea Trujillo and Alexander Guzmán, who are doing extraordinary work in fostering collective awareness about the importance of female leadership and intergenerational empowerment in Colombia. It is truly inspiring to see how initiatives like these are opening doors and creating opportunities for the future. Without a doubt, this has been one of the best gifts I have given myself this year, and I am filled with enthusiasm to continue contributing to creating spaces where more women can lead and make an impact.""",123,LIKE,39,PRAISE,12,EMPATHY,9,APPRECIATION,1,INTEREST,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5622AQF8Ix4g4xRPHQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1583209848633?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=oOvOlelv5xGOiu737mvdBoH6w5Q-i1j-cIxKmXCcKIE,5,29,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6138294234794512384?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6138294234794512384%29,Lanzamiento ofcial de Savills Colombia  gracias @UKinColombia y Savills  ,29,LIKE,,,,,,,,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/v2/D5627AQFu-HJ8a1xQEw/articleshare-shrink_800/articleshare-shrink_800/0/1752194159147?e=1753653600&v=beta&t=NFrAMVCwqyoh18TBfjuVfpTK2YRjoCmdj0TYqVZvUGM,13,130,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7089311779532537857?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7089311779532537857%29,Proud to lead Macquarie’s Core and Core + Real Estate acquisitions in Mexico.,109,LIKE,21,PRAISE,,,,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFkvns_bPXGFQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1701781011923?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=Ost60MBOmJdCJSd-pQ-JjB-TCv2j4WGwj3XADIxN1As,6,135,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7137786907840655360?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7137786907840655360%29,"Mañana estaremos con un grupo de expertos en el mercado de Real Estate latinoamericano, hablando de las proyecciones para LATAM, los momentos tan retadores que vivimos  y cómo la creatividad, disciplina y consistencia nos pueden ayudar a navegar la tormenta y aprovechar las oportunidades.

We started with this idea in 2016 - how can we develop a scalable platform that works within the banking industry, not around it, for the cannabis industry?

After 3 years of ideation, countless meetings with industry executives and knowledge experts, a healthy SAFE round with strategic investors and then hiring a team of really smart people, we have built a SaaS platform for the enablement of real banking relationships within the cannabis industry.  We have spent thousands of hours on the development of the entire platform as we gear up for our national launch in 2019.

Our patent pending platform has been vetted by a wide variety of individuals all along the way.  From dispensary owners, growers, state regulatory agencies, bank compliance officers, BSA personnel, federal and state financial examiners and a host of technology experts.  Our national board of advisors, a group of unmatched professionals across the industry touch points, has been integral to our preparation and development.

"I am a seasoned real estate investment banking professional dedicated to delivering strategic insights, transaction expertise, and capital solutions to clients navigating the global property landscape. Currently serving as Managing Director, Partner at GFG Securities, LLC, I lead a team focused on real estate M&A, debt and capital raising, as well as buy/sell advisory for an international client base.

Prior to joining GFG in 2016, I honed my expertise managing institutional real estate portfolios at PGIM Real Estate in Mexico. There, I oversaw over $3 billion in assets under management—spanning major public REITs such as Terrafina and PRUMEX—ensuring optimized performance and robust, risk-adjusted returns.

Leveraging more than a decade of experience, I bring a blend of analytical rigor, market intelligence, and strategic deal execution to advance high-stakes transactions and long-term growth objectives for investors worldwide.

"With over 40 years of experience in investment banking, corporate finance, and private equity, I am the President & CEO, Partner, and Co-Founder of Pan American Finance. Our Miami-based firm specializes in M&A advisory and capital raising services, focusing on clean energy and sustainable infrastructure. Since 2003, we’ve successfully completed 87 transactions valued at over $5 billion, with more than $2.5 billion directed towards clean energy initiatives.

Previously, I served as CFO of Ibero American Media Partners, a $500 million private equity platform, and as Vice Chairman of Cisneros Television Group, where I played a key role in the merger with El Sitio, forming Claxson Interactive Group (NASDAQ: XSON) in 2001. I also held positions at Violy, Byorum & Partners, Citicorp Securities, and Continental Bank, gaining experience across New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and London.
In addition to my professional pursuits, I am a director of the Osteosarcoma Collaborative and a senior advisor to the ALS Recovery Fund, both focused on advancing research and patient care for ALS and bone cancer. I graduated from St. Benet's Hall, University of Oxford.

Travel agencies around the world depend on NTC to facilitate travel payment transactions, as well as related industries such as hotels, tour operators, car rentals and more. This year's award speaks largely to NTC’s exclusive payment platform NTC ePay, and the various features that Travel Advisors and even chapter organizers have come to appreciate. This year's award also marks the 3rd consecutive year of recognition by ASTA for technology and payment processing. NTC provides ASTA the mutual benefit of a revenue stream for the association while providing competitive rates and innovative payment integrations to ASTA members.

   NTC ePay is a platform to create payable links like Electronic Invoices, Social Media Posts with Integrated Payments and even e-commerce shopping cart capabilities or an event ticketing system. These links can be sent via SMS text messages, email or embedded into a website or social media site to present service or product details with the option for the viewer to purchase directly from the messages or posts. All this can be done without the need of an existing e-commerce site and can be set up in less than an hour.

   In developing the platform, special attention was given to the challenges of travel agents and agencies and the nature of collecting on customized pricing for services and products that usually don’t fit the cookie cutter approach to traditional off the shelf e-commerce platforms. With NTC ePay businesses can present specialized offerings with add-ons and deductions in a simple, intuitive interface.",textComponent,Strategic Partner/Member · Dec 2005 - Present,American Society of Travel Advisors,FALSE,Associated with National Transaction.com,insightComponent,,,Jan 1997 - Present,MyNTC.net,,,,,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQESiM5L3vtNLA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0/1674565844862?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=I6PyfG0Yt0ZUZZsiE6tQlfdMlv4FFch0oUSYbZJafk0,100,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQESiM5L3vtNLA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0/1674565844862?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=I6PyfG0Yt0ZUZZsiE6tQlfdMlv4FFch0oUSYbZJafk0,100,200,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQESiM5L3vtNLA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1674565844862?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=LcvEBfqc0_1fQKJ_rtXUR1xH9A76HQgP8sSuETpTUbk,200,400,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQESiM5L3vtNLA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1674565844862?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=sI3Us1Tq9TpRo8Bgv4a4Z_TLK2OMcwPJY0gjHMPwVGw,400,500,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQESiM5L3vtNLA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1674565844863?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=6xTQ5wCx7ft10qBmYu7eDdqworlHZA8l5agVj6D2KBA,500,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQESiM5L3vtNLA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1674565844863?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=6xTQ5wCx7ft10qBmYu7eDdqworlHZA8l5agVj6D2KBA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,markfravel,FALSE,"Contact National Transaction Corporation today at 888-996-2273 to see how we can help you with your Travel Merchant Account, or visit us online at www.nationalTransaction.Com for more information.",textComponent,"Travel Research Online · Feb 8, 2017",Get The Best In Payment Processing With National Transaction Corporation,FALSE,,,"Travel Research Online · Aug 8, 2016","Mark Fravel, Founder and President of National Transaction Corporation","February 11, 2016, Megan reported directly to Mark",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQF-wz7mivMVuA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0/1627958121485?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=OxCJJe_DCnn1-ciEhWokLxju6UNSw-ynUDCSQm56x8U,LARGE,"Mark is a very honest person, he only wants to help other business owners and give them the best advice.

Michael advises owner-founders, executives, entrepreneurs, and family-owned businesses by identifying and optimizing well planned exits, recapitalizations, and divestitures often part of succession planning, retirement, partner separations, and unplanned life events. 

One of Michael’s favorite messages he wishes to convey to all prospective sellers is “I would rather meet you three-to-five years out from your exit then in the same year you plan to sell.”

He provides a data-based, fresh perspective on current products and promotions that simultaneously build the balance sheet and make member financial lives better.

I had the pleasure of working with Bill for over a year at UNCLE Credit Union as a member of the executive leadership team where we collaborated, brainstormed and constantly looked for ways to meet the challenges that marketing, lending and the credit union faced. 

William joined the team at UNCLE during an unprecedented time (COVID-19) yet still managed to effectively move the lending discipline and the credit union forward. With calm leadership he quickly assessed the existing situation and positively crafted new paths forward for lending products including HELOCs, Credit Cards, and PPP loans. 

He created a close partnership between marketing and lending and was a champion of using data to help marketing provide relevant lending products, offerings and campaigns.

He has an infectious positive attitude that opens up a room and helps the team focus on meeting member needs and creating credit union results.

I have been impressed with his knowledge, expertise and results orientation and focus since the day I met him.  Karl brings both a strategic vision as well as the ability to achieve practical results to any situation I ever saw him presented with.    I have found him to be a capable and resourceful leader who enables people, a motivator for his team, and a creative problem solver.  He is an excellent and skilled communicator, both written and verbal and has the ability to share his vision in a powerful and impactful way.  

Karl is success oriented, results driven and a true innovator when presented with a difficult situation. He understands relationships, both internal and external, build rapport and support rapidly and is an excellent teammate. He leads at both an executive strategic level and hands-on tactical level with his team. He coaches his team with respect and provided focused leadership to the entire marketing team and to the senior leadership team as well.

Karl is honest in his communications, delivers on his commitments and meets the all too frequent changes in direction with calm and consistent leadership.  He is a dedicated manager, a determined professional and a dependable teammate. I highly recommend him.  Please feel free to reach out to me for further information on Karl Goin if needed.

"As the Head of Treasury at SellersFi, I lead the treasury digital transformation to enable SellersFi business drivers, by designing and implementing cash and liquidity management infrastructure to bank partners and SellersFi loan management system. 

Previously as the VP for Digital Payments and Operations, I streamlined and integrated SellersFi operations processes and controls, preparing the company backoffice to support the rapid business expansion.

As the CTO for Safrapay expansion to the USA, I oversaw the 100% cloud based Bank Acquirer (Base24-eps, CMM, uP Framework, PRM) (Azure), Digital Banking (Jack Henry Associates - AS400) and Card Issuing (FIS - zOS) implementation and integration, managing more than 150 professionals, distributed in Brazil, USA, and Europe, while negotiated and managed large vendors such as IBM, ACI, Accenture, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, among others.

At ACI Brazil, I managed key accounts business development and project implementation, including First Data, Safrapay and Banco Itau. In 2018, I was awarded the ACI President's Club Award for Banco Safra card acquirer implementation in Brazil, which involved ACI product customization for ISO-8583BR and the Brazilian clearing house standards and regulations.

In an interview with The Hill, Guzman cited an Aspen Institute study that found that lack of investment in Latino-owned small businesses is contributing to a $900 billion marketplace inefficiency. Correcting that marketplace inefficiency, according to the research, would also produce around 4.2 million jobs.

Small-Business are responsible for about 46% of the US GDP and 48% of total employment. Small-Business also play an important role to financial independence of minorities groups in the US. 
However, not only minorities, but a significant share of Small-Business has limited access or no access at all to Credit sources. 
That’s why FINTECs as SellersFunding are of National Importamce to the United States, by enabling access to credit and nurturing Small-Business to growth!

"Nearly two decades of specializing in both business valuation and M&A, I am proud to contribute to Northeast Florida to Savannah, Georgia and beyond with my expertise in valuation, business strategy, and transaction advisory.

Deeply rooted in Jacksonville, Florida, I have developed close referral partnerships with transaction attorneys, lawyers specializing in: litigation, family law, estate and Tax, CPAs, and financial advisors (CFAs). We work together to provide outstanding services to owners of privately held companies, who view me as their trusted friend and growth partner. 

My firm focuses on B2B, manufacturing,  transportation and logistics, healthcare and metals. As a member of Oaklins, we are one of the largest lower middle market investment banks in the world. We have broad reach in every industry segment.  

Valuation:  No size too big or small - my company’s independent appraisals are relied upon by business owners, executives, accountants and attorneys to support estate and tax planning, financial reporting, purchases or sales of companies, or complex litigation. With M&A expertise, I inform our valuation work with real market feedback.  

M&A:  Fiercely representing business owners is part of my brand DNA, in growth, sale, or exit.
I build strong relationships with my clients. I take time to understand my clients’ unique needs, desires, and wants to design a transaction process to meet their goals.

Even though my primary focus is on maximizing the seller’s interest, I am honored to have been recommended by private equity and other buyers to represent business sellers from whom they want to buy. It is in everyone’s best interest to have expertly executed and fair transactions on all sides.

I hold a Series 24, 79 and 63 license from FINRA for investment banking activities and I am also a licensed real estate broker for the state of Florida. 

Working with entrepreneurs to realize the value of what they created is my passion, in growth, valuation, and exit.

I love music and play guitar, piano, and harmonica.  I also enjoy reading about a variety of topics: Economics, weather, history, politics, and learning about people and their special talents.

I love solving problems for my clients, big or small. Knowing that they call me for help is very rewarding and getting the right answers for them is extremely gratifying.

I value strong ethical relationships built on trust.

I look out for my clients' best interests, and sometimes that requires me not just telling them what they want to hear, but rather what they need to hear.

The business slowed down significantly throughout COVID, but established an effective pandemic operating plan. 

I continually managed the business throughout the COVID pandemic, navigating challenges to re-open the locations and rebuild memberships, which eventually concluded in successful negotiation of profitable sale at a high multiple in September 2021 to an Atlanta based Private Equity group.

In addition, I managed to grow business into a multi-unit, full service Health Club Company, with 25,000 customers and 600 employees in 18 locations in Miami and Puerto Rico. 

Moreover, I led and managed acquisition of the Lady of America Franchisor on December 2011, taking full control of the HCOA unisex brand. 

Lastly, I removed franchising rights of clubs in December 2013 prior to the sale of the HCOA Fitness operation.

Among my Notable Highlights & Contributions, I:

- Developed strategic restructuring plan after company’s acquisition out of Chapter 11 in October 2009, resulting to sale of 75% of the equity to a New York Private Equity group in December 2013 and securing an equity return of 1,200%. I also executed post-sale agreements to facilitate smooth transition of business to new ownership group.

- Created a new system to effectively manage sales force, achieving 15% increase in revenue in the first 12 months. I reduced maintenance costs and increased EBITDA by 15% through the development of weekly cash flow management reports prioritizing capital investments across various facilities.

- Oversaw all aspects of the $1M health club facility project in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, generating an incremental cash flow of 21%. The facility became a showcase model for the new HCOA brand in Puerto Rico.

We had sold our Orangetheory territory to a private equity group with a major platform.  As an add-on, there was no expectation for me to stay on, and truthfully, I had structured it that way. I wanted a complete exit—no lingering ties, no transitional role, just a clean break.

But when it happened, the quiet caught me off guard.

There were no more team calls to prep for, no leadership updates to review, no sense of momentum pulling me forward.

Just stillness.

The kind of stillness that feels foreign when you've been in motion for a decade.

In that silence, I began to realize just how much of my identity had been built around urgency.  Around being needed.  Around having somewhere to be, someone to lead, and benchmarks to surpass.

I didn't miss the stress, but I did miss the presence—the daily rhythm, the unspoken camaraderie, the feeling that I was part of something alive.

When that structure fell away, what was left was space.  And space is not always comfortable.

So I stepped back.

I gave myself time, not for a sabbatical or some curated reinvention, but for something simpler.

To sit with my family without distraction. 
To be around my kids without rushing off. 
To ask questions I hadn't had time to consider in years.

Naturally, people started reaching out.

""Are you planning to take another CEO job?"" 
""Will you be launching something new?"" 
""Is there a franchise you're looking at acquiring?""

I understood why they asked.  But I didn't feel the pull.  Not yet.  I wasn't looking to fill the space just to avoid it.

Eventually, I needed a project—something tangible, something real.  I bought a mountain property in Colorado.

I renovated it and turned it into a short-term rental.

It wasn't some master plan.  It was just a project I could do in peace, without pressure.  It was something I could finish without needing it to be the next big thing.

During those months, I wasn't building a new business.  I was rebuilding clarity.
I wasn't preparing a plan.  I was asking questions I hadn't had space to ask in years.

Who am I without being needed every day? 
What do I do when no one's waiting on me? 
Can I sit in the silence without trying to fill it?

The exit wasn't a mistake…
It was a reckoning.

And in the quiet that followed, I realized this:

A liquidity event isn't just about putting money in the bank.  It's an invitation—sometimes a disorienting one—to pause, to reflect, and to sit with the uneasy excitement of discovering what comes next.

Most founders chase the next thing to avoid the quiet.  I chose to embrace it.  That's where the real work began—finding purpose beyond achievement, writing the first lines of an authentic second act.",144,LIKE,31,EMPATHY,12,PRAISE,4,APPRECIATION,4,INTEREST,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGk4TLKlDiRuA/feedshare-shrink_800/B4EZX70n6EHYAk-/0/1743686633392?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=UyXGE7DOINjgAT0sqGu_LpVQs_no7jJuK_5fEN2_8gc,3,14,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7313551828120465409?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7313551828120465409%29,"You sold the business—but you didn’t walk away.  You rolled equity, stayed on as CEO, and now you're leading a PE-backed platform.

Your mandate is to grow the core, do bolt on acquisitions, and scale toward a second exit.

But here’s where founders run into trouble:

The pace of dealmaking cannot outpace the platform goals.

When I was running HCOA, one of our bolt-on acquisitions doubled EBITDA.  But it took two full years to integrate—aligning culture, syncing financial systems, reworking incentives, and capturing real synergies.  We couldn’t afford to chase the next deal until we made that one work.

But once it was integrated, it gave us the foundation to absorb another add-on—and that set the stage for our exit.

Remember,  it’s not just about doing deals - it’s about making the deals stick.

Here’s what matters:

- Every acquisition needs a real integration plan before the LOI
- Cultural alignment isn’t optional—it’s foundational
- Incentives must roll up into platform-wide KPIs
- Financial systems and reporting have to be consistent
- Real synergies must be realized

You don’t grow just by buying—you grow by absorbing

If you’re in the seat post-transaction, act like it’s your capital on the line.

- Push for integration discipline.

- Stay close to the financials.

- Don’t chase new deals until the foundation is solid.

That’s how real platform value gets built—and exits get earned.

But would you buy it?

That’s the real question—because buyers don’t just care how many units you’ve sold. They want to know if the system can thrive without you.

In most franchise deals, the cracks don’t show up at the core. They show up at the edges.

Too often, brands expand before they stabilize—bringing in the wrong operators, chasing momentum, and neglecting consistency. That’s when value begins to erode.

If you're building toward an exit—or just want the option—here’s what actually matters:

1.) Solid unit-level economics

The benchmark is clear: 4-wall EBITDA margins should be north of 20%. No add-backs, no excuses. Buyers want each unit to stand on its own—consistently and profitably.

2.) Territory structure that creates leverage

Well-zoned development areas with future “relief” locations. Your territory map isn’t just a growth plan—it’s a strategic asset with clear white space.

3.) Development schedules that are aggressive—but achievable

Unrealistic timelines tank deals. Smart buyers want scale, but they also want discipline.

4.) A leadership team that keeps innovating

Concepts go stale fast. If your leadership isn’t evolving the brand, the market will leave it behind.

5.) Franchisees who build businesses—not buy jobs

You’re not just selling units, you’re building a network. If the operators aren’t strong, neither is your system.

6.) Support infrastructure that enforces consistency

A true support structure—real estate, field operations, onboarding, and brand standards—has to be in place. The system should operate consistently across markets, without relying on constant oversight.

7.) A functioning Franchise Advisory Council

Your FAC isn’t a formality. It’s a signal. Buyers see it as a proxy for trust, alignment, and operational health.

8.) Recognizable brand and sticky customer loyalty

Marketing matters—but only when it leads to retention. A franchise that customers return to is worth more than one they simply talk about.

I saw this firsthand at Orangetheory.

The franchisor didn’t just grow fast—they grew with discipline. They brought in strong operators, entered key markets ahead of the competition, invested in scalable infrastructure, and built a customer culture that lasted.

Between 2017 and 2021, M&A activity exploded.
Buyers weren’t just chasing a trend. They were pursuing a system that had the foundation and the leadership to keep growing.

That’s what “built to exit” really looks like.

So I’ll ask again:
Would you buy what you’re building?

Friday, July 25 | Bridgehampton

An intimate gathering of select voices shaping the future of authenticity in art, design, and technology.

Hosted by Arius Technology Inc. and Entoro, this off-the-record evening features a curated guest list of collectors, founders, and cultural investors—centered around a fireside conversation, champagne, and caviar at Stella Flame Gallery.

We’ll explore trust, ownership, and provenance in a time when value is increasingly verified, not assumed.

Final few invitations are being extended

It is easier to understand SEO by knowing what the mistakes are and avoiding them rather than learning SEO techniques that are no longer valid.
SEO techniques are constantly changing and it can be dangerous to use techniques from an old book. What rarely changes in the SEO space are the mistakes! Common SEO Mistakes: Basic Edition is a compilation of the 25 Basic Search Engine Optimization Mistakes That Can Kill Your Business!
This book is designed to help you understand the importance of avoiding SEO mistakes. Search Engine Optimization is a tricky subject and I decided to take a different approach with this book than a lot of the books that are out there. This is because sometimes you need to know what you are doing wrong first before you can understand how to fix it. The challenge with a lot of the SEO books is they try to teach you what SEO is and then let you go and do it. For many this can help them up to a certain level and then hurt them as time goes on. This is because SEO is always changing so the good techniques that are learned from a book that was written a month ago could be bad techniques today. However, the one thing that rarely changes are the SEO Mistakes.
This book came about because I am always answering questions from clients, prospective clients, colleagues and friends. I felt like I was constantly repeating myself because over time the same answers kept coming up. Clearly there are a lot of common SEO mistakes out there that need to be addressed.
I set out to write them down and today am still writing because I continually see new mistakes taking shape. This will be a never ending battle because of the way the search engines work. As the public gets close to deciphering the algorithms it becomes easier and easier to get on the top search results pages. Read More . . .",textComponent,"Scott W.

ABOUT CROSSROADS

CrossRoads is a full service Business Brokerage and M&A firm that delivers outstanding results to our Sellers.

The price the business will end up selling for is heavily influenced by not only how effectively the business is packaged, positioned, and negotiated with prospective Buyers, but as importantly, how effectively we can create competition amongst multiple interested parties.  Value perception helps our goal of maximizing the selling price and reaching your objectives. 

WHAT OTHERS' HAVE SAID:

“We interviewed 16 certified M&A agencies and narrowed the field to four finalists including one who had won national titles. Crossroads stood out from the start because of their superior organization, thoroughness of protocols, and above all being communicative. Even-though there were nearly 70 interested inquiries, we only needed to spend time with the three best prospects, while Crossroads screened the remainder on its own. Within five months, the offer was 4% higher than our listed price. Tim Hatamian, CEO, PLEMCo”

"With 25 years of relative experience, and a veteran, I am hands-on leader of technology initiatives and cross-functional roles for private equity/M&A,  and public sector (government) crisis management. The following are noted accomplishments that pioneered the CIO role and created substantial value for stakeholders:
-	Supported management of companies when driving rapid growth and profit improvement through operational and strategic technology changes, with a particular focus on eCommerce/Omni-channel, AI open data algo solutions in order to capture price and customer advantages in the market. 
 -       Advised several boards of directors, government officials, and served in interim positions for numerous private equity-oriented situations. I was a frequent guest speaker to private equity firms on the effective use and competitive advantages of technology, mostly recently on large data AI to impact the value chain in PE portfolio companies and funds themselves. 
-	Started a firm, that became well referenced in the private equity community for value creation and interim-CIO roles, leveraging next generation cloud architecture, data intelligence, and ERP optimization
-	Expanded solution-base with growing understanding of fabric/AI solutions, automated development of operational data to support management decisions, and logic for market pricing. 
-	Worked closely with funds (internally) for development of deal thesis and transaction mandates; especially in carve-outs and merger integration (roll-up) positions. 
-	Spent the post-covid timeframe as a volunteer with the Red Cross disaster cycle services and a personal charity. Obtained FEMA crisis management certification and other disaster training.",United States,"Naples, Florida, United States","Naples, Florida",2010,Non-Profit Organization Management,linkedin.com/company/team-rubicon-inc-,Team Rubicon,51-200,teamrubiconusa.org,1342,,,,,,,,,,,,,1 yr 1 mo,1.08,FALSE,Nov 2024 - Apr 2025,,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Microsoft,,,,,,,,,,,"Azure AI Engineer, Finance Functional and Data Intelligence Training, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Azure, Fabric",Microsoft,FALSE,1996 - 1999,5290,https://www.linkedin.com/company/5290/,urn:li:fsd_company:5290,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQFQu7wZniptpA/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1677690194092/the_wharton_school_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=3d54XnKAp1myCO1lMGya1gWf-FOlRA-ig6TjKar60w4,,,,,,,,,,"Bachelor's degree, Management and Organizational Dynamics",The Wharton School,,FALSE,Jul 2024 - Present · 1 yr 1 mo,799168,https://www.linkedin.com/company/799168/,,urn:li:fsd_company:799168,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHdnbuquOY_7g/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1674765492977/teamrubicon_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=U31YimIrCjpkgq8CwkCa_L4vDjRerRNYB9s45UNpLQQ,"Naples, Florida, United States · On-site",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Team Rubicon · Part-time,Disaster Recovery Coordinator,FALSE,2019 - Present · 6 yrs 7 mos,157239,https://www.linkedin.com/company/157239/,,urn:li:fsd_company:157239,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHUWIQmmDRJOw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1656603670184/american_red_cross_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=j4zPcHfjvP8d3mFfjcX1CDRG-gzNjqi7gIwyjaW-BHk,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States · Remote",,"Disaster Cycle Services; Psychological First Aid, DCS Finance Management;  Government Operations Center Management; Disaster Workforce Supervisory, FEMA Operations",,textComponent,American Red Cross Disaster Action Team,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/v2/D5627AQGmrdMLqiPzTw/articleshare-shrink_800/articleshare-shrink_800/0/1712144992863?e=1753653600&v=beta&t=yYJsNFKUKajjFZ-0g46mgWeSkIc474JVO5OVG9HO9mk,mediaComponent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,American Red Cross · Freelance,"Disaster Action Team - National HQ, Finance and SF Gov't Operations (Volunteer)",FALSE,Jan 2014 - Present · 11 yrs 7 mos,10562345,https://www.linkedin.com/company/10562345/,,urn:li:fsd_company:10562345,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQEA6Z8i4b8NAA/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1640226946428/triton_vc_logo?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=MDrhP55XqD64DenjkWcGRnoI8KGrYWFquk65NyIjiBc,"Naples, Florida, United States · On-site",,"Deep expertise in the end-to-end operational value chain; and its enablement with dozens of financial and operational ERP, security remediation, and comprehensive cloud-technology platform improvements.

Taking a moment to reflect on an incredible journey that began before our wedding 31 years ago. Michael Reed and I have built a beautiful life together, filled with love, adventure, and achievements. 

We are proud parents of two amazing children who inspire us every day. Watching them grow into their own remarkable adults has been one of our greatest joys.

Together, we've ventured into the world of entrepreneurship, co-founding five private companies and two nonprofits. Each endeavor has taught us invaluable lessons about resilience, teamwork, and the impact we can make when we align our passions with purpose.

Now, we are thrilled to be working together once again with the unparalleled team at Republic Capital Group where we can combine our strengths and shared vision with their purpose to create even more positive change.

Here's to love, family, and the power of partnership! ❤️
Taylor R. & Dylan Reed
